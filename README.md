puissance_4
===========

This was the second group project I completed while at Dev Bootcamp. It is a game of Connect Four (with a French flare - puissance 4 is french for connect four) played on the command line over Twitter. 

We integrated with the Twitter API to send and receive tweats that, when sent in a particular format (*******|*******|*******|**X****|**O**O*|**O*XX*|), are interpretted into a move. It can be played human vs human, human vs computer, and computer vs computer. Unfortunately, our AI wasn't fully implemented when released, but was built such that the game can be toggled between a game played solely on the command line and a game over Twitter.
